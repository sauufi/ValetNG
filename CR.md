ValetNG Privacy Policy

Last updated 2022-12-20

ValetNG respects and protects the personal privacy of all users, so we disclose this privacy policy to the public. Your use of v2rayNG means that you have read and agreed to the terms. If you do not agree to the terms, please stop using and uninstall v2rayNG immediately.

collect message

ValetNG software itself will not send any information to the developer, but the application market (such as Google Play) where you download the software may collect relevant information about the running status of the application and provide it to the v2rayNG developer. For this information, please read the privacy policy provided by the application market you use.

ValetNG software may contain functions that need to be unlocked through IAP payment, your payment information will be processed by the relevant IAP channel, and we have no access to payment information.

When you report an error in the running of the software to the v2rayNG developer, the developer may ask you to provide software and system logs to help confirm the cause of the problem. Since the logs may contain sensitive information, such information can only be sent by you. We do not make any express or implied guarantees for the security and privacy of any transmission service, please choose a method that is acceptable to you when transmitting relevant information.

Information Sharing

We do not sell collected user data to any third parties. We may provide information to external developers to assist in the development of the software, but we will communicate and confirm compliance with any confidentiality obligations before providing the information.

information retention

Unless otherwise required by relevant laws, we will clear user data that is no longer required for further use within 30 days, or consolidate statistical data into comprehensive reports that cannot identify individual users.

information leakage

We will use reasonable technical and security measures to protect user data, but we cannot guarantee the absolute security of data. If we confirm that a data breach has occurred, we will notify users through available channels within 7 days. You agree not to hold us accountable for any losses caused by force majeure.

Modification of terms

We reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy, but will ensure that users are notified via our available channels and in-app prompts at least 30 days prior to the updated terms. Continued use of the software after the new terms take effect constitutes your agreement to the revised privacy policy.
